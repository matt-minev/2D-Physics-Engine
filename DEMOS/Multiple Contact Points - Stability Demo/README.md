**Esc (Escape)** → Close

**Mouse Motion** → Moves one of the boxes

# Information

This demo showcases collision detection with multiple contact points between polygons.

# Explanation

Move the box so it collides with the static box in the middle. Drawn on the screen are the different contact points between the two boxes.  
Instead of having just one (as in previous demos), multiple contact points are calculated to ensure proper handling of impulses in collision resolution.  
It uses the same clipping algorithm as Box2D, which is crucial for enabling stable box stacking.
