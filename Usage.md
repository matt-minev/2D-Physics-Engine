## Introduction

Impact Engine is designed to simulate 2D physics using rigid bodies that can be circles, boxes, or general convex polygons. It integrates forces (like gravity, wind, friction, and even springs) and handles collisions between bodies. A typical simulation follows this cycle:

- **Setup:** The engine initializes the graphics window, creates a physics world, and sets up static and dynamic bodies.
- **Input:** User input (mouse clicks and key presses) spawns new bodies or toggles debug modes.
- **Update:** Physics integration (applying forces, integrating velocities/positions, collision detection/resolution) is performed.
- **Render:** Bodies are drawn using either textures (if provided) or debug primitives.
- **Cleanup:** When the simulation ends, resources are freed and the window is closed.

---

## Project Structure Overview

The engine is organized into several files and modules:

- **Main.cpp:** Entry point that creates an Application object and runs the simulation loop.
- **Application:** Manages the overall simulation flow (setup, input handling, update, render, and destroy).
- **Graphics:** Contains static functions and variables to manage the SDL window, renderer, and drawing routines.
- **Physics Module:**
  - **World:** Holds all physics bodies, applies forces, updates physics, and performs collision checks.
  - **Body:** Represents a rigid body with physical properties (position, velocity, mass, etc.) and a pointer to its shape.
  - **Force:** Contains helper functions to generate forces (drag, friction, spring, gravitational).
  - **CollisionDetection:** Provides static methods for detecting collisions between bodies (circle-circle, polygon-polygon, polygon-circle).
  - **Contact:** Represents collision information (contact points, normal, penetration depth) and resolves collisions.
- **Shape Module:**
  - **Shape (Abstract):** Base class for all shapes.
  - **CircleShape:** Implements circular geometry.
  - **PolygonShape:** Implements convex polygons (also used for boxes).
  - **BoxShape:** Specialized polygon representing a rectangle.
- **Vec2:** Implements basic 2D vector mathematics including addition, subtraction, rotation, dot and cross products.

## Getting Started

To compile and run Impact Engine, follow the steps from Impact Engine's official GitHub repository. (Or the ones below.)

### Windows

1. **Visual Studio 2022:**

   - Download and install [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/). During installation, ensure you select the **Desktop Development with C++** workload so that the Visual C++ compiler is installed.

2. **Project Setup:**

   - You have two options:
     - **Option 1:** Download the complete Visual Studio project as provided.
     - **Option 2:** Create your own Visual Studio project and copy the `src`, `assets`, and `lib` folders into your project directory. Then add these folders to your project via the Visual Studio Solution Explorer.

3. **SDL2 & SDL2_image:**

   - Download the development libraries for Visual C++ from:
     - [SDL2 Download](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases)
     - [SDL2_image Download](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image/releases)
   - Make sure to install the latest 2.x.x versions of both libraries and not 3.x.x.
   - Extract SDL2 to a global folder (e.g., `C:\SDL2`).
   - Extract SDL2_image and copy its contents into the same SDL2 folder, merging with the existing files. This ensures that both libraries reside under the `include` and `lib` directories.

4. **Linking SDL Libraries to the Project:**
   - Right-click on your project name in the **Solution Explorer** and choose **Properties**.
   - **Configuration:** Select the desired configuration (recommended: Debug Win32 to support 32-bit machines).
   - **VC++ Directories:**
     - **Include Directories:** Add `C:\SDL2\include`
     - **Library Directories:** Add `C:\SDL2\lib\x86` (using x86 ensures compatibility with 32-bit systems)
   - **Linker Settings:**
     - Go to **Linker → Input → Additional Dependencies** and add:
       - `SDL2.lib`
       - `SDL2main.lib`
       - `SDL2_image.lib`
   - **DLL Files:**
     - Copy the DLLs (`SDL2.dll` and `SDL2_image.dll`) from `C:\SDL2\lib\x86` (or x64, if applicable) into the same directory as your `.vcxproj` file.

### Main Entry Point (Main.cpp)

- **main() Function:**
  - **Purpose:**
    - Creates an instance of the `Application` class.
    - Calls the setup routine.
    - Enters a loop that continually processes input, updates the simulation, and renders the scene.
    - On exit, calls the destroy routine to clean up resources.
  - **Flow:**
    ```cpp
    int main(int argc, char *args[]) {
        Application app;
        app.Setup();
        while (app.IsRunning()) {
            app.Input();
            app.Update();
            app.Render();
        }
        app.Destroy();
        return 0;
    }
    ```

2. **Setup()**

   - **Purpose:** Initializes the simulation.
   - **Key Actions:**
     - Opens the graphics window via `Graphics::OpenWindow()`.
     - Creates a new `World` with gravity (note: a negative gravity value is expected, e.g. -9.8).
     - Adds static bodies (floor, left and right walls) to contain objects.
     - Adds a static box with a texture to act as an obstacle.
     - Applies a global wind force to all bodies.
   - **Code Highlights:**
     ```cpp
     void Application::Setup() {
         running = Graphics::OpenWindow();
         world = new World(-9.8);
         // Create floor and walls
         Body* floor = new Body(BoxShape(Graphics::Width() - 50, 50), Graphics::Width()/2.0, Graphics::Height()-50, 0.0);
         // ... similar for leftWall and rightWall, then add them to world.
         // Create a big static box with texture
         Body* bigBox = new Body(BoxShape(200, 200), Graphics::Width()/2.0, Graphics::Height()/2.0, 0.0);
         bigBox->SetTexture("./assets/crate.png");
         // Add wind force to all objects
         Vec2 wind(0.5 * PIXELS_PER_METER, 0.0);

       - For boxes and polygons: either draws a textured quad or a wireframe polygon.
     - Finally, presents the rendered frame via `Graphics::RenderFrame()`.
   - **Code Highlights:**
     ```cpp
     void Application::Render() {
         for (auto body : world->GetBodies()) {
             if (body->shape->GetType() == CIRCLE) {
                 // Draw circle using texture or debug primitive.
             }
             // Similar handling for BOX and POLYGON.
